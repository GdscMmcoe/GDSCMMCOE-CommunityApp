# GDSCMMCOE-CommunityApp

## A Community App for Google Developer Student Clubs MMCOE

### Problem Statement :-

Google Developer Student Clubs was established in AY 2020. In the Period of pandemic it was tough to spread awareness , it’s goal and community expansion was limited.Indeed word of mouth and Social media are great platforms but we needed to have our own app for timely updates and a one place for all the things related to our club at our fingertips. Thus, this app can be used effectively for the same.

### Proposed Solution :-

This very app is designed by our own team members, in which we aim towards updating about our upcoming events on the timeline as well as the revision of past events, we also share the useful resources , allowing us to contribute to any open source project if any, is being carried out. It gives an overview about the GDSC and many more. Students don't need to register themselves in order to use this app.


### Functionality and Concepts Used :-

The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students stay updated about our club and expand our community. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :

1. Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.

2. Simple & Easy Views Design : User-friendly and attractive interface ensures the end user’s comfort to deal and operate the app. 

3. RecyclerView : To present the list of past events that are being carried out and to display the list of team members.

4. Navigation Component Library : This has been used for the framents navigation, bottom Navigation and side navigation view.

5. View Model, LiveData & Room Database : We are also using LiveData to update and view team member details, the data is being further stored locally into the room database.


### Application Link and Future Scope :-

The app is currently in the testing phase under institute level with a limited number of users.

The future scope of this app is to extend its functionality by adding the blog section to enable the users to read the blogs and also the app sharing feature over which we are currently working. We aim that more students should join and be a part of this club and use this app for sure.
